# Memory Game

This is a simple memory game built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The goal of the game is to match all of the pairs of cards as quickly as possible.

## How to Play

1. Choose a difficulty level by clicking on one of the buttons at the top of the game board.
2. Click on a card to flip it over.
3. Click on another card to try to find a matching pair.
4. If the cards match, they will stay flipped over and you will earn points.
5. If the cards do not match, they will flip back over and you will need to try again.
6. Continue until all of the pairs have been matched.
7. Try to beat your high score!

## Game Rules

- You can only flip two cards at a time.

## Scoring

- You start with 100 points.
- For each second that elapses, 10 points will be subtracted from your score.
- If you choose a harder difficulty level, you will receive a bonus score.
